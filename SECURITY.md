# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report it privately through GitHub:
[open a security advisory](https://github.com/chikolokoy08/ph-toolkit/security/advisories/new).

Do not open a public issue for a security problem.

Include what you found, how to reproduce it, and the version you were running.
A proof of concept helps but is not required.

This is a volunteer-maintained project. I aim to acknowledge reports within 7
days and will keep you updated as I work on a fix. If a fix is needed, it ships
as a patch release and the advisory is published once it is available.

## Scope

ph-toolkit is a library with no runtime dependencies, no network access, and no
file system access. It reads the values you pass and returns values. The things
worth reporting are:

- Input that makes a validator or formatter throw instead of returning `false`
  or `null`.
- Input that causes unbounded memory use or makes a function hang, such as a
  pathological case in one of the patterns.
- Anything in the published package that is not built from this repository.

Wrong data is a bug, not a vulnerability. A barangay under the wrong city, or a
valid mobile prefix that is rejected, belongs in a normal issue.

## Supported versions

The latest release. This project is pre-1.0, so fixes go into the current minor
version rather than being backported.
